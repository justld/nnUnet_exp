    one padder to pad them all. Documentation? Well okay. A little bit
    :param image: nd image. can be anything
    :param new_shape: what shape do you want? new_shape does not have to have the same dimensionality as image. If
    len(new_shape) < len(image.shape) then the last axes of image will be padded. If new_shape < image.shape in any of
    the axes then we will not pad that axis, but also not crop! (interpret new_shape as new_min_shape)
    Example:
    image.shape = (10, 1, 512, 512); new_shape = (768, 768) -> result: (10, 1, 768, 768). Cool, huh?
    image.shape = (10, 1, 512, 512); new_shape = (364, 768) -> result: (10, 1, 512, 768).
    :param mode: see np.pad for documentation
    :param return_slicer: if True then this function will also return what coords you will need to use when cropping back
    to original shape
    :param shape_must_be_divisible_by: for network prediction. After applying new_shape, make sure the new shape is
    divisibly by that number (can also be a list with an entry for each axis). Whatever is missing to match that will
    be padded (so the result may be larger than new_shape if shape_must_be_divisible_by is not None)
